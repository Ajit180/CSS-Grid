Question 3: Explain the use of grid-auto-row and grid-auto-column using code examples.

Solution: 


grid-auto-rows
Purpose: Specifies the size of any auto-created rows in a grid layout. This property comes into play when there are more grid items than rows defined in grid-template-rows.
Usage: You use grid-auto-rows when you want to control the height of the rows that the grid layout automatically generates for additional items.



grid-auto-columns
Purpose: Specifies the size of any auto-created columns in a grid layout. This property is used when there are more grid items than columns defined in grid-template-columns.
Usage: You use grid-auto-columns when you want to control the width of the columns that the grid layout automatically generates for additional items.
